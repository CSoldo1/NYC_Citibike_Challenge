# NYC_Citibike_Challenge

## Overview
My objective is to convince investors that a bike-sharing program in Des Moines is a solid business proposal. Using Tableau, I analyzed bike trip data from New York City and solidified my proposal with several visualizations. 

## Resources
* Tableau Public 2022.4
* Python
* Data: 201908-citibike-tripdata.csv

## Analysis
Before I could upload the data into Tableau, the data type of the "tripduration" column needed to be changed from and integer to a datetime to get the time into hours and minutes. I completed this transformation using Pandas (refer to NYC_Citibike_Challenge.ipynb). I then uploaded the "new_tripdata.csv" into Tableau.
